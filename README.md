# Taxalotl
This is python package for merging taxonomies to continue
the releases in the OTT series of taxonomies.

The code is based on parts of the
    [reference-taxonomy](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/reference-taxonomy)
    repository, which was written primarily by 
    [Jonathan A. Rees](https://github.com/jar398) as 
    a part of the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/)-funded 
    [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org)
    project.
    

Thanks to the US NSF
